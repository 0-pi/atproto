# NEXT-SASS

Why would I use this, Jim?

* You have a really simple website you need to build and you don't want minimal dependencies and a small package.json
* Maybe you're tired of using CSS-in-JS.

### Setup (MacOS)

Start by cloning the repository, or by clicking on **Use this template** above.

Then run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3005` in your browser of choice. Enjoy!
